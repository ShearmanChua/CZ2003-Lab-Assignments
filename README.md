# CZ2003 Lab Assignments

Nanyang Technological University CZ2003 - Computer Graphics and Visualization Lab Assignments

## OBJECTIVE

During five lab sessions, you will learn how to visualize curves, surfaces and solid
shapes defined by mathematical formulas. Upon completion of these labs you will
know:
• How to define shapes by implicit, explicit and parametric analytic functions, and
• How to make shape morphing from one parametrically defined surface to another.

## INTRODUCTION
You will use educational visualization software—function-based extension of Virtual
Reality Modeling Language (VRML) and Extensible 3D. To avoid learning
VRML/X3D and concentrate on visualization principles—mathematical definitions,
coordinate domains and sampling resolutions—you will use the provided source code
templates to only fill them in with mathematical formulae and visualization parameters.
VRML and X3D are ISO standard file formats for describing interactive 3D objects and
virtual worlds. They are designed to be used on the Internet, intranets, and local client
systems. They are also intended to be universal interchange formats for integrated 3D
graphics and multimedia. VRML and X3D are capable of representing static and
animated dynamic 3D and multimedia objects with hyperlinks to other media such as
text, sounds, movies, and images. VRML and X3D are following declarative
programming style, i.e. it tells the computer what to do. It differs from the imperative
programming style, like in C and in a popular graphics library OpenGL, which tell the
computer how to do things.
